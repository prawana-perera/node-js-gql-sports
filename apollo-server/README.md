# apollo-server

The Apollo Server is a simple, Express-based implementation of Apollo Server (https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/), a spec-compliant GraphQL server that can be used with any compatible GraphQL client.

Simply install the node_modules (we use Yarn) and start the server.

The GraphQL playground can be access via http://localhost:4000/graphql where you can inspect the current schema, and execute queries.
